<h1 align="center">üöÄ SwiftLet</h1>

<p align="center"><strong>SwiftLet is a lightweight Python framework for running open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) locally using <code>safetensors</code>.</strong></p>

**Swiftlet** is a lightweight and educational framework that provides reimplementations of various Large Language Models (LLMs).  
It is designed for **learning**, **experimentation**, and **local execution** of models ‚Äî all without relying on external LLM libraries.

## üöÄ Features

- ‚úÖ Local execution of supported LLMs  
- ‚úÖ Minimal dependencies, easy to understand  
- üì¶ Clean architecture for adding more models  
- üîç Designed for research, prototyping, and educational use  
- üõ†Ô∏è Open for contributions and experiments

## üß† Implemented Models

| Model     | Status               | Notes                         |
|-----------|----------------------|-------------------------------|
| Gemma 1   | ‚úÖ Working            | Text-only                     |
| Gemma 2   | ‚úÖ Working            | Text-only                     |
| Gemma 3   | ‚úÖ Partially Working  | Vision support not implemented |

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è More models will be added soon!

## Planned Features

SwiftLet is under active development. The following features are planned for future releases:

- **Integration with Native Runtimes**  
  Support for running LLMs via optimized backends like `llama.cpp` for improved performance on local machines.

- **File Interaction Support**  
  Enable LLMs to read and process local documents, files, and structured data formats.

- **Modular Tool Integration**  
  Easily connect models to external tools, functions, or APIs to extend their utility.

- **Enhanced Model Management**  
  Tools to manage multiple models, switch between them, and handle custom configurations.

- **Prompt Templates and Inference APIs**  
  Built-in support for structured prompting, templates, and customizable inference pipelines.

- **Extensibility and Plugins**  
  A modular architecture that allows developers to add new capabilities with simple plugin hooks.

- **Performance Monitoring and Debugging**  
  Tools for logging, inspecting model behavior, and optimizing local performance.
